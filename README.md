Tilemap Game :
The player moves using the arrows on the keyboard, up, down, left, right.
If the player takes a boat - he can walk on water
If the player takes a goat - he can walk on mountains
If the player takes a pickaxe - he can carve mountains and turn them into grass

Important ! : To carve in the mountains you must take the goat (so you can stand on the mountain) then press X
And the mountain will turn into grass!
